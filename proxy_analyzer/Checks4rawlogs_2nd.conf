# This is checks config for logs processor. It must be correct Perl script as executed with do().
# For each field in output here defined an array for checks. Each check is specified with hash
# which contains the following keys:
# DATA_FILE - file with list of matched tockens. If DATA_FILE is undefined (the same as '' or "")
#    the whole check hash does not work. So if you need to switch check off just comment DATA_FILE
#    key. 
# FUNC - how to perform matching
# - Now the following functions are implemented:
# -- MatchSearch - regexp search with immediate output of matched line. 
# 		In this case DATA_FILE content must have the following structure:
#		<regexp to match>##<output file>
#		where 
#		--- `regexp to match' is PCRE regular expression
#		--- `output file' file name with path where to write result.
#		DATA_FILE can contain comments starting with `#'
#
# Possible keys of %ParserCfg::Checks (see InputOutputFileFormat.conf):
# USER_LOGIN USER_IP USER_AGENT LOCAL_TIME REFERRER DOMAIN SITE_IP PORT BYTESOUT BYTESIN PROTOCOL
# TRANSPORT METHOD URL CONTENTTYPE HTTP_CODE ACTION GMT_TIME
# 
# This file is mandatory, but specified with --list paramenter for each run. No defaults specified.
#

%ParserCfg::Checks = ( #Keys must match Output fields in %ParserCfg::Proclog
	USER_IP => [
		{
			DATA_FILE => "users_in_troubles.txt",
			FUNC => "MatchSearch",
