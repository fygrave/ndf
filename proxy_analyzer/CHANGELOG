proc_log_v07.pl

16.04.2013 Add ability to process log line as simple split. If %ParserCfg::Proclog in IO config contains defined
	DELIMETER key, script will use simple `split' to transform log line into array of fields

16.04.2013 Each process now writes its own output file containing time() and PID in name. This fixed issues with 
	flock during simultaneous write by different processes and speed up script performance. An --append 
	flag removed.
